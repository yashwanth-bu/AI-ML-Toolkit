# Beginner AI Project Notebooks

This folder contains beginner-level AI and machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter notebooks. 

## Purpose

The projects focus on foundational concepts and algorithms to help learners understand:

- **Regression:** Predicting numerical values (e.g., house prices, student scores).  
- **Classification:** Categorizing data into classes (e.g., iris species, spam detection, Titanic survival).  
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).  
- **Basic Neural Networks:** Simple applications like handwritten digit recognition.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Introductory content-based recommendations.  

Each notebook is designed to be **easy to follow**, data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

## How to Use

- Each project has its own `.ipynb` file named according to the task it performs.  
- New beginner-level projects can be added by simply creating a new notebook in this folder.  
- These projects are ideal for practicing and reinforcing basic AI/ML concepts before moving on to advanced models.
