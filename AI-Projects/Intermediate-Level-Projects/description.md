# Intermediate AI & ML Projects

This folder contains intermediate-level AI and machine learning projects focused on **applied ML with real-world datasets**. 

## Purpose

These projects are designed for learners who have mastered beginner-level concepts and want to apply them to more **complex problems**. They cover:

- **Classification:** Credit card fraud detection, sentiment analysis, fake news detection, facial expression recognition.  
- **Regression:** House rent estimation, customer churn prediction.  
- **Computer Vision:** Image classification, traffic sign detection, facial expression recognition.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment analysis, fake news detection.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Collaborative filtering-based recommendations.  
- **Speech & Audio Processing:** Speech emotion recognition.

Each notebook contains:

- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Model selection and training  
- Evaluation and analysis  
- Applied examples on real-world datasets  

## How to Use

- Each project has its own `.ipynb` file named according to its task.  
- New intermediate-level projects can be added simply by creating a new notebook in this folder.  
- Ideal for learners who want hands-on experience with **practical AI applications**.
